To view chess pieces pictograms you need to install any UTF-8 chess pictograms 
compatible mono wide font (e.g. DejaVu Sans Mono) and assign it as a console font
(via registry editor).

After that - right click on the console window and choose Properties. 

From there you can change the font to see chess pieces pictograms.


Otherwise, you may use numbers instead pieces pictograms via menu.
